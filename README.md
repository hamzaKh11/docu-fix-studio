## ATSmooth (Docu-Fix Studio)

### 🎯 Project Idea

ATSmooth is a web application designed to help users create and optimize their CVs (Curriculum Vitae) to be compatible with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). The application allows users to either upload an existing CV for analysis and improvement or manually input their data to build a new one from scratch. The app leverages AI to generate optimized and professionally structured content.

The core idea is to streamline the CV creation process, making it easier for job seekers to create professional, ATS-friendly resumes that increase their chances of landing interviews.

### ✨ Key Features

CV Creation: Users can fill out a comprehensive form including personal information, work experience, education, skills, and certifications.

Upload Existing CV: Users can upload their CV file (PDF, DOCX) to be automatically parsed and have its data extracted.

AI-Powered Optimization: The app uses advanced AI language models to refine the wording of job descriptions and experiences, making them more impactful and ATS-compliant.

Live Preview: A real-time preview of the CV is displayed as the user enters or modifies their data.

Save Progress: Users can save their work and return later to complete their CV.

CV Export: The final CV can be generated and exported in both PDF and Google Doc formats.

Secure Authentication: A secure user registration and login system to save user data and CVs safely.
